## ðŸŒ… **My name is George**

I'm a 24 year old Ecuadorian-American born and raised in Astoria, Queens. I enjoy thrill seeking, gaming, anime, and nature. I have a lovely beagle friend named Cooper who is an old pup with a soul that is forever young! My favorite thing to do when I'm bored is go on a nature walk and practice mindful meditation.
